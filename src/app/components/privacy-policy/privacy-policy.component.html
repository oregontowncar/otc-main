          <p>“Personal Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, and telephone number or email address.

            <h6>1. What Information Is Collected.</h6>
            <p>Oregon town car collects the Personal Information that you provide to us through our Web Sites, our Worldwide Reservations Center, and directly through Oregon town car sales employees. We may collect information in additional ways from Users of our Web Sites, as explained in this Section and Sections 2 and 3. Users may browse through the informational portion of our Web Sites without providing us with any Personal Information. However, if you request information or materials from us, we may ask for your contact information, such as your name, email address, company name, address, and phone number. In addition, we may collect personal information from you when you send us emails or submit other forms of information directly to us. We may also collect personal information from you at other points on our Web Sites that state that Personal Information is being collected. To access and make reservations through the online reservations system offered by Oregon town car International at our Web Sites, we will require you to complete a registration form. This registration form will request certain Personal Information about the Web Site user (“User”) and the traveler who will use our transportation services (“Client”) in the event the Client is different from the User. This information will be compiled into a profile. Such information may include at least the following: for the User, name, address, email address, company name, phone number, and ARC or IATA number; and for the Client, name, email address, phone number, company name, work address, home address and billing address, pick-up and drop-off information, credit card information, corporate account information, and in-transit itineraries. In addition, we may use a feature of your browser called a “cookie” to identify you while you are using our Web Sites. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our Web Sites. Cookies make your internet experience quicker and more convenient. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our Web Sites may not work properly if you do. We may also use cookies for other purposes, including enhancements to the reservations system. In addition, we may also collect User’s IP addresses and browsing habits (such as pages viewed and other clickstream data) to help us analyze traffic on the Web Sites, and we may have link identification numbers when Users link to the Web Sites from web sites of our partners.</p>

We may outsource to a third party the hosting and operation of the Web Sites. However, such third parties do not and will not have any ownership interest in the Personal Information collected or any right to use the Personal Information apart from the operation of our Web Sites. For Personal Information we receive from third-party reservations agents, systems or centers, Oregon town car owns, jointly owns, or has the appropriate licenses to use such information.

            <p>You can control the content of the Personal Information we have collected by following the instructions stated below in Section 5. In addition, if you do not want to receive marketing materials or communications from us or, subject to Section 5, do not want your contact information disclosed to third parties apart from the delivery or administration of our services, you can opt-out. We only share your Personal Information with third parties in limited circumstances where: We provide your Personal Information to service providers we have retained to perform services, or process Personal Information, on our behalf, only to the extent necessary to deliver or administer such services. We require service providers to process Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy or other similar or appropriate privacy measures. Access, use, preservation, or disclosure of Personal Information is reasonably necessary for Oregon town car to detect, prevent or remedy security or technical issues, or suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity; to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, ordinance, or legal process, including government investigation; or to protect the rights of Oregon town car, our clients, or other individuals, as required or permitted by law.

In the event that we use your Personal Information in a manner different from that described in this Privacy Policy, we will notify you and offer you a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of: (i) the use of your Personal Information for such purposes; or (ii) the disclosure of your Personal Information to a third party. In the unlikely event that sensitive information (such as a medical or health condition, race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, etc.) is provided to Oregon town car, Oregon town car will offer you the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly consent to: (i) the use of sensitive information in a manner different from that described in this Privacy Policy; or (ii) the disclosure of sensitive information to a third party (“opt-in”).
